# TextEdit.it
**About**

This is a simple text editor for Mac that is mostly built with SwiftUI. It is designed to take up less resources and less storage, and be used in small quick bursts of writing or note taking. It uses its own proprietary .textedit document format. Other text formats will be implemented soon.

## **Features**

 - Easy to learn interface
 - Familiar text editing commands
 - Easy access to priority commands in the sidebar
 - Full system font bar at the top of the text editor panel

## **Features To Be Implemented**

 - More file formats
 - Export to other file formats
 - In-app Finder metadata integration for the document
 - The ability to accept images
 - Support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
 - An iOS/iPadOS version (possibly)

## **Things To Note**

 1. This project is free to be added to by the community, if you wish to help, file a issue with the enhancement tag
 2. Any and all feedback will be helpful for future development
 3. If you wish to report a bug, please use either the feedback button in the app or use GitHub issues.
 4. Please don't expect it to be great on the first few versions, I am still learning to code and still trying to understand how macOS works
